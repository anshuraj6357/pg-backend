PG Website â€” Professional Frontend (React + Vite)
-------------------------------------------------

What I built for you:
- A clean, product-quality React frontend (JSX) with semantic HTML and SEO meta tags.
- Smooth Book Now -> Enquiry scroll behavior everywhere.
- A backend-ready EnquiryForm component (commented POST ready) with localStorage fallback and CSV download.

How to run locally in VS Code:

1. Install Node.js (v16+ recommended).

2. Extract the ZIP and open the folder in VS Code:
   File -> Open Folder -> select this project folder.

3. Open VS Code terminal (Ctrl+`), then run:
   npm install
   npm run dev

4. Open the URL printed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes for production:
- Connect EnquiryForm's submit to your backend API: replace the localStorage block with a POST to your server or use Firebase.
- Replace placeholder images in /assets with real photos.
- Update owner email in App.jsx or pass through environment variables.
- For SEO: host on a public URL; add sitemap and robots.txt as needed.

Files of interest:
- src/components/EnquiryForm.jsx (form & lead capture)
- src/App.jsx (main layout)
- index.html (SEO meta tags)

If you'd like, I can also:
- Integrate Google Maps distance check (needs API key).
- Connect to Google Sheets or Firebase for lead saving.
- Add unit tests and CI config for production readiness.
